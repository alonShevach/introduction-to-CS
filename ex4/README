A program that runs the known hangman game,
and a program that checks the function update_word_pattern in the hangman.py file.

section C - q1:
1st i chose the check first of the function works correctly when given a letter that occur twice in the word,
that it will update the pattern correctly.
2nd test is to see if the pattern will not put the letters again if they occur in the pattern already.
3rd test is to see if the function will correctly update all the characters in the pattern, and return the given word.
4th test is to test that it wont do anything if the letter is not in the word.

section C -q2 :
if we needed to change the game to hebrew, first i needed to get a new fuction that
changes hebrew letters into indexes(for my functions).
2nd for hint functions, i needed to change the function running on the english indexs of letters
to 22(if we will play without ending hebrew letters).
if we play with ending hebrew letter we need to leave it as 22,
but to convert that normal letters will be understood as last letters too.
also if there are ending hebrew letters we need to make a function that if the last letter is (ף, ך, ם, ן)
it needs to change it to the (פ, נ, מ, צ) letter in the wordslist
, (exept some words ending with normal פ). 

*Design:
- I think that the main function (run_single_game) should be shorter (dividing it into multiple functions)
- But in this specific case it would have caused a function with a high number of arguments (4-6) and I
- thought that it will make the code slower, and it is better to leave it a bit long
