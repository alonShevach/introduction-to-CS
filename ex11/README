in the file we have the Node class, which is a class for each part of the tree.
we have the class Record, which is a class for illnesses and thier symptoms.
and we have the diagnoser class, which receives a root for a binary tree,
and it has methods on that tree.
methods:
- diagnose:
diagnose an illness that fits to the given symptoms, from the tree.
- calculate success rate:
calculating the tree's success rate by getting records.
- all illnesses:
returns a list with all the illnesses on the tree.
- most rare illness:
returns the illness that appears less in the tree.
- paths to illness:
finds all the paths to a given illness in a list.

part 2:
is creating a function that builds a tree by given records and symptoms.
for this we have the 2 functions build tree and build tree helper.
and we have the optimal tree, which gets records and symptoms and
returns the tree with the biggest success rate according to the calculate
success rate function.
