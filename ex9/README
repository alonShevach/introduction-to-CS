-car.py :
contains a Car class type, each car has its own orientation, location and length.
from the car orientation and location it has coordinates, and each car can move towards
its orientation. this time we chose 'udlr' directions.

-board.py:
contains a Board class type, for board games with cars in them.
this time we use it for rush hour game.
each car on the board is Car type cars, and the board has target location
which is a location the cars needs to arrive to win.
the board in this game is 7*7 size.

-game.py:
contains a Game class type, for the rush hour game.
it gets a json file from the user and uses it to create the cars on the
board, then it starts the game.

IMPORTANT!!
Board_possible_moves:
I used 3 nested for loops, but 1 of them runs on 1 object in our game,
the other runs on 2 objects.
I chose to do it because if we will want to play another game, the cars
might be able to move more than 1 space in each direction.
so the nested loops are not inefficient in out program.


less important:
because i chose to make the board and the game classes to be able to succeed with
every target's location given, the function '__str__' at board is a little long.
note that i had a nice and short function, but after adding the function to
be good with all different target's locations, it became a little long.
