a program that finds words in a given matrix, with the given directions.
the program takes the matrix and the words for the search from 2 given files.
also the user needs to provide an output file name for the output(which words appear in the matrix,
and how many times they appear.) and the user provides direction from 8 directions.
all the program can run from the shell/cmd.

the functions i chose:
main(args) function:
this function is the main function, her 'job' is to run all the other functions by thier order,
also this function is the function recieving the args from the user, and divides it to other arguments
for the use of the script.
main function calls the "check_input_args(args)" function, which her 'job' is to
check if the given arguments fits to the program needs, which are:
two input files, that the name is written correctly and the files exists,
and name for an output file(does not have to be existing, the program will make one if not)
and direction for searching the words.
after that the main function takes the arguments and divide them to
thier porposes, first 1 is the name of the words to search, second is
the matrix, third is the name of the output file, and fourth is the
directions + checking if there is no direction that appears twice.
then the main function calls the functions:
read_matrix_file(filename)
read_word_list_file(filename)
find_words_in_matrix(word_list, matrix, directions)
that are instructed for us to build.
in find_words_in_matrix i created some sub-functions that are:
find_word_with_direction(word, matrix, direction)
and inside the function we use some more functions:
create_line_for_downwards(matrix)
reverse_matrix_lines(matrix)
matrix_turn_upside_down(matrix)
create_full_diagonal_matrix(matrix)
reverse_whole_matrix(matrix)
find_forward_word_in_matrix(word, matrix)

"find_word_with_direction" find single word with a single direction.
by using the function "find_forward_word_in_matrix".
the function rotates, reverse and changes the matrix to make the matrix
become like the direction is from left to right, then it uses the
"find_forward_word_in_matrix" to find the words from left to right.

create_fulle_diagonal_matrix(matrix), is using another function for building half of
the diagonal matrix, called "create_half_diagonal_matrix(matrix)".

then after main function takes the results of the search it calls the function
"write_output_file(results, output_filename)"
and then it finishes.

check_wordsearch:
i called the function "test_find_word_with_direction"
i imported everything because the function needs alot of other functions.
i created a matrix, and wanted the function to find the words in it.
1st test i tested if it finds the words from left to right, and with 'w' direction.
2nd test i tested if the function will do well when the word is can be found twice in the
same direction, and by using letter in more than 1 word. also checked for the opposite direction.
3rd tese i tested if the function finds the direction 'd' and if it words well with
capatilized letters.
4th test i tried all direction to see if it will find a capatilized letter when i asked for non
capatilized.
5th test i tested if it words well with the 'x' direction, and the 'u' direction, also checked
if the function is doing ok with duplicated directions, not using the same direction twice.
